  m_text: "It's a report exploring scientific assertions in fiction novels. The chapter
    about Frankenstein has been bookmarked.\r\n\n<i>\"\u2026 incidentally, Frankenstein's
    method of reanimation is as much science as Sch\xF6nberg's cacophony might be
    considered music, or Picasso's daub might be qualified as art. There is as much
    \u2014if not more\u2014 alchemy non-sense in the description of his processus
    of the recreation of life as there are proper scientific considerations. But what
    if we took it seriously anyway for a brief moment? Would the spark of life be
    able to invest the body of a dead man through Electricity?\r\nThere again, the
    answer must be no: The sheer power of the electric shock would be more than enough
    to completely cook the brain of the corpse. And even if a miracle happened and
    the brain would start functioning again, there is absolutely no guarantee that
    the same individual as before would emerge from death. Brains decay from the very
    first moment of death \u2014who can say what kind of conscience can be restored
    from damaged material? Certainly not yours truly \u2014but what I can say is that
    it will not be the person you knew when they were alive...\"\r</i>\n\nWhen I tried
    to take the book, I heard a faint sound like a clicking. In such an old manor,
    it wouldn't surprise me to find secret passageways hidden behind one of these
    bookcases.\r\n"
