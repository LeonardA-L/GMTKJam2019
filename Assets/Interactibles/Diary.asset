  m_text: "There is a worn out diary lying on the floor.\r\n\n<i>\"June 7th, 19xx\r\n
    \   There was a letter at home this morning, with nothing but a key and a small
    note. 'It's all yours now. Love you.' No name to sign it, but there is no need
    for that. I would recognise this handwriting anywhere.\r\n    Grandmother has
    always loved such cryptic messages, but this time I am afraid I understand very
    well the meaning of it, though I wish I am wrong with all my heart. When we last
    parted, I said some harsh words that I now regret immensely. I fear that this
    is the last memory of me she will bring with her on her last journey.\r\n    I
    had so many questions still & so much  knowledge to gather from her wisdom & I
    don't want her to go.\r\n    I shall depart at once for Hawthorne Mansion to clarify
    this matter.\r\n    Merle Hawthorne\"\r</i>\nThe last page of the diary was ripped
    away.\r\n\nThere was a piece of key with the diary.\r\n"
