  m_text: "This is a torn page from Hawthorne's diary. The handwriting is somewhat
    scribbled, as if they wrote it in a moment of hurry or under some sort of tension.\r\n<i>\"
    \   \u2026 are all charlatans and conmen. They are not worthy of being part of
    my great discovery. Dead people can be brought back; Of that I am intimately persuaded
    now. There are multiple examples of that, both in ancient and modern literature.
    The key was to consider all the pieces together. It is clear to me now that alchemy
    alone could not be the answer. But combined with the knowledge of enochian teachings...\r\n
    \   If science wants to disregard the forces that govern life and death then so
    be it: I will cast it away as a broken tool, not fit for the grander purpose of
    my doings, and turn to other means that were brought upon me.\r\n    Today shall
    be the greatest of days, when finally my research shall prove to all that I am
    not the mad person they are all so keen to describe. I shall wake her from eternal
    sleep, whatever may be the cost.\"\r</i>\nA big <i>\"3\"</i> written in red ink
    covers most of the page.\r\n"
