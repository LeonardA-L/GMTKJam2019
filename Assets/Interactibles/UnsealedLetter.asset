  m_text: "An old letter lies open on the table.\r\n\n<i>\u201CMx. Hawthorne,\r\n
    \   It is the last time that I shall answer one of your ignominious letters. I
    shall not be associated with a fallacious person who does not take science seriously
    and sullies its name with such inept allegations. Medicine is not, as you write,
    a \"false science designed to deceive the foolish masses\", and certainly not
    \"a house of secrets and conspiracy keeping away the ultimate knowledge\".\r\n
    \   Medicine is, in fact, one of the most reliable science to this day. It saves
    lives, Mx. Hawthorne, contrary to your childish fantasies. You are wasting your
    time and, more importantly, you are wasting mine.\r\n    Please take note that
    my lawyers \u2014and all of my esteemed colleagues in the country\u2014 are informed
    of your harassing behaviour. I hereby demand that you immediately cease to make
    any form of contact with me, otherwise Justice shall take your case in my stead.\r\n
    \   Regards,\r\n    Dr. Henry Wallenstein\"\r</i>\n\n\u2026 There was a piece
    of key with the letter.\r\n"
